## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Ai Prompting
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.com/) - An efficient alternative to `create-react-app` for building React projects.


### What I learned

I decided to write this project in React.js. It wasn't an easy process but I saw myself going back to refresh on the fundamentals of css, js and new stuffs like react states and props.

### Continued development

Going forward, my focus areas will be react props and states. I need to have a consolidated understanding of how they work and how they affect the whole scope of a feature in building. Learning that props in react could be used with the spread operator `...props` almost made me go lazy with wanting to use it in all my props instances but discovering that it wasn't good practice put me in check. 

I also came across modern css selectors like `:has()` and `nesting`. These too, will have my focus shifted to them in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [React.dev](https://www.react.dev/learn) - This helped me a great deal with implementing the overall project in react. I got a good laugh when I learned that default components in react can be imported into other components with very unrelated names like `import { banana } from 'utils.js'` provided that "banana" in the utils.js file is exported as a default app. (lol)

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_appendchild.asp) - I found hardcoding the ratings from 1 to 5 quite unnecessary, so I needed to know how to tell the program to do that for me with few instructions which led me to practising this.

- [www.freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-box-sizing-border-box-css/) - My css became buggy along the line and this article from freecodecamp gave me some insight into crushing bugs the box-sizing way.
